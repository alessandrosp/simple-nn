Simple Neural Network
=====================

Work in progress, currently in development. I am trying to create my own Neural Network library for Python. If youâ€™re searching for something working and well optimised you should check (PyBrain)[http://pybrain.org/].

This is mainly for fun. (:

Feel free to drop me a line (on Twitter)[https://twitter.com/annoys_parrot] for any feedback.
