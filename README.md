# Simple Neural Network

## Introduction
Work in progress, currently in development. I am trying to create my own Neural Network library for Python 3. If you’re searching for something working and well optimised you should check [PyBrain](http://pybrain.org/).

This is mainly for fun. (:

Feel free to drop me a line [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/annoys_parrot) for any feedback.

## Tutorial (draft)
To create a perceptron, which is a neural network without hidden neurons, you can simply do:

    import simplenn.neural_network as snn
    perceptron = snn.NeuralNetwork()
